			Hello World, and Welcome to Chasing Comet Studios!
			<br />
			<br />
			This is a temporary placeholder.
			<br /><br />
			Swisher is an incredibly handsome and smart man.
			<br /><br />
			This is known.
			<br /><br />
			This will soon be a real website, but for the time being, we have told the search engine robots to NOT index this website. We don't want Google to index this temporary content. We only want it to be indexed by the search engines once our actual content is in place. We have disabled the search engines from crawling our site by using the robots.txt file in the source folder.
			<br /><br />
			Once we upload the actual content, we will remove the robots.txt (or amend it) to allow crawling of our content.
			<br /><br />
			If you don't know about robots.txt, then maybe google it, or ask ChatGPT.
			<br /><br />
			Or maybe.... just maybe... you can simply ask your mentor... jus' sayin'...

			Don't worry... Google already knows how incredibly handsome and smart Swisher is... so no need for you to point it out.
			<br /><br />
			Just enjoy it... revel in the Swishy Goodness.
			<br /><br />
			Hmmmm... yeah. Nice.
			<br /><br />
			That's Swisherrific... perhaps even Swishtacular...?
			<br /><br />
			But definitely Swisherlicious...
			<br /><br />
			Oh, yeah...
